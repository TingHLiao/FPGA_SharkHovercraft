# FPGA based Shark Hovercraft
It's a final project of Course Logic Design Laboratory.

## Description
See the website above for designing the hovercraft using a 3D modeling software and STL files.
Instead of a controller, we used a Android APP to control the Shark.
After connnecting the Shark and APP by bluetooth, you can make the Shark float, move forward, control direction.
Below is the picture of finished product.
